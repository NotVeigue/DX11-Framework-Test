# DX11-Framework-Test
A simple game built using the first draft of my DirectX11 framework to assess its usability.

Built using Visual Studio 2015.

This project is still quite unfinished and there is not much to see in terms of actual functionality, so I don't recommend you attempt to build it. 

For anyone still determined enough to see the compiled result, your best bet is probably to rename the vs folder to .vs and the suo file a few folders within it to .suo. This should allow you to open the project with all of my build settings and linkage intact. After that, just build Engine first, then PuyoPuyoGame.
